# Filebench_Test_Suite
This is the custom test suite for filebenchmarking using filebench, tweaked to test the performance of computers with 2 cores and 4 GB ram.
It uses filebench to analyse performance under a variety of predefined loads, and a python script to visualize the result.

The whole test suite consists of:
1. Random reads on a 1 gig file
2. Random reads on a 5 gig file
3. Random reads/writes on a 1 gig file
4. Random reads/writes on a 5 gig file
5. OLTP simulation workload
6. Fileserver simulation workload
7. Webserver simulation workload

# Installing Filebench
Please refer to the README of the project for more information
https://github.com/filebench/filebench
1. Download tar distribution of filebench  (1.5-alpha 3) https://github.com/filebench/filebench/releases/download/1.5-alpha3/filebench-1.5-alpha3.tar.gz
2. Download Yacc (bison)& Lex (flex) as a prerequisite for installing filebench
`sudo apt-get install flex bison`
3. Extract the tar distribution of the filebench.
4. Then, change directory to extracted filebench folder. Proceed with configuration, compilation, and installation as usual:
`$ ./configure`
`$ make`
`$ sudo make install`
5. Check if itâ€™s installed by running typing `filebench` on your terminal.
6. Disable virtual address randomization, switch to root shell and exit.
`sudo sh -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space"`

# Running the experiment
The repo comes with a predefined bash script. All you need to do is execute
`bash script.sh` in the root directory.
Every testcase takes 10 minutes to run, the whole script should be finished in ~70 minutes.
The log results should be stored in /log directory.

# Visualizing the experiment
Once you have the log ready, then you can visualize it! Try opening viz.py to get a grasp of what it's doing.
It needs at least 1 log files to generate a plot with 2 values.

In general, you need to:
1. Set file paths to the results that you have got and what you wanna compare it against.
2. Call the functions to parse the log file that you've got.

This is the example of the visualization, depicting comparison of random reads on a 1 gig file between a digital ocean droplet and my local machine.

# Things to note:
1. Please ENSURE virtual address randomization is of or Filebench won't run properly.
